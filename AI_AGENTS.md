# AI Agent Context — drdebug.dev

## Summary

*one paragraph: what this site is, what it does*

drdebug.dev is the pre-launch landing page for Doctor Debug, an observability layer that watches AI agents built on no-code platforms (Lindy, Relay, n8n) and translates failures into plain English. When an agent breaks, instead of an engineer-written stack trace, the user gets a plain-language explanation and a specific fix path — an expired API key reads as an expired API key with renewal steps, a malformed handoff reads as a mismatch between two workflow steps with the line to change. A pattern library maps error signatures to fixes and sharpens as more agents are watched. This page exists to validate demand: it explains the product in one screen and captures waitlist signups ahead of a six-week Lindy pilot.

## Audience

*one sentence: who this is for (broad demographic)*

Non-developers — marketers, operators, and consultants — who build and run AI agents on no-code platforms but can't read the engineer-written error logs when those agents break.

## ICP

*the specific ideal customer — demographics, pain points, what they use today. More detail than Audience: Audience is the broad demo ("homeowners with EV chargers"), ICP is the specific targetable subset ("Tesla owners in CA who installed in last 90d, paid $2k+")*

Solo operators and small agencies (marketing agencies, real estate offices, consultancies) running five to ten AI agents on Lindy, Relay, or n8n to handle leads, scheduling, and routine ops. They are non-technical: comfortable wiring up a no-code workflow but unable to parse a stack trace, payload reference, or schema error. Their pain is acute and recurring — agents work until they break, and when they break, the error log is a foreign language, so they lose hours guessing, posting in r/nocode and Facebook automation groups, or abandoning the agent entirely. They currently rely on community forums, trial-and-error, and the platform's own cryptic error UI. Reachable through r/nocode, r/n8n, Facebook automation groups, and the Lindy/n8n community channels. Validation-tier prosumers sit at ~$15/mo; the real revenue ICP is the five-to-ten-agent agency paying $49–99/mo for shared dashboards, Slack alerts, and audit logs.

## Goals

*1-2 sentences: primary business / product goal*

Validate demand before significant build investment: capture a qualified waitlist and recruit twenty Lindy users for a six-week pilot that measures first-try fix-resolution rate by error class.

## Tech stack

Astro project under the sites/* workspace. Build path goes
through the parent `sites/Makefile` (Docker-orchestrated) which delegates
per-stack work to the central builder at `~/work/projects/builder/`.

## Project structure

- `src/` — application source
- `public/` — static assets copied to `dist/` at build (favicons, OG images, `_headers`)
- `docs/` — PRD, Prompts log
- `Makefile` — thin forwarder to `../Makefile`
- `wrangler.jsonc` — Cloudflare deploy config
- `scripts/` *(if present)* — ingester or build-time helpers

## Building info

All dev work runs inside the parent `sites1` docker container. The host doesn't
need Node/pnpm installed; the container does. The parent `Makefile`
(`../Makefile` from this dir) is the canonical entry point.

### Why docker

- Pinned Node + pnpm versions match Cloudflare's build env.
- Avoids polluting the host with per-project node_modules.
- Same image serves every sibling project under sites/.

### Common Makefile targets

This project's local `Makefile` forwards every target to `../Makefile` with
`proj=drdebug.dev`, so these all work either from this dir or from `sites/`:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make buildsh` *(from `sites/`)* | Drop into a bash shell inside the docker container at `/usr/src/app` (= `sites/` mounted in). |
| `make run` *(from here)* / `make run proj=drdebug.dev` *(from `sites/`)* | `pnpm install` then start dev server (auto-detected). |
| `make check-vite proj=drdebug.dev` | Start the dev server, skipping install. |
| `make test proj=drdebug.dev` | `pnpm install` + `pnpm build` + `pnpm test`. **Hard-fails outside docker** — `make buildsh` first, or `docker exec`. |
| `make deps` | Install pnpm globally (image bootstrap). |
| `make clean` *(from `sites/`)* | Remove root `package.json`, lockfile, node_modules. Don't run inside a project dir. |

### Running Make targets from a Claude Code session

The Bash tool runs on the host as `vijo`, not inside docker. To execute a
target inside the container, find the running container and `docker exec` in:

```bash
docker ps                                               # find the sites1 container name
docker exec -w /usr/src/app <name> make test proj=drdebug.dev
```

## Deployment info

- **Platform:** Cloudflare Workers (Static Assets) — *not* Vercel.
- **Config:** `wrangler.jsonc` at the repo root — points `assets.directory` at `./dist` and uses `not_found_handling: "single-page-application"` for SPA client-side routing.
- **Headers:** `public/_headers` — cache (`/assets/*` immutable, HTML no-cache) + security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`). Vite copies `public/` into `dist/` at build, so the file ships with the assets.
- **Build:** `pnpm build` → `dist/`. Wrangler picks up `dist/` via `wrangler.jsonc`.
- **Deploy:** `wrangler deploy` (locally) or via Cloudflare's Git integration on push.
  Initial GitHub repo + CF Pages project setup is automated by the portfolio CLI:
  `cd ../portfolio && make run ARGS="deploy drdebug.dev"` runs `gh repo create` and
  POSTs to the CF Pages API with `build_command="pnpm run build"` set explicitly
  (avoids the bun-detection trap kwizicle.com hit). Idempotent; safe to re-run.
- **Vite version:** must be ≥ 6.0.0 — Wrangler's Vite integration rejects Vite 5.
- **Env vars:** set `VITE_*` vars (e.g. `VITE_GA_ID`) in the Cloudflare Workers project's environment-variable settings — they're inlined at build time.
- **Live URL:** https://drdebug.dev/  *(update once first deploy succeeds)*
- **Legacy:** if a `vercel.json` or `.vercelignore` is present from a Lovable export, it's inert on Cloudflare and safe to delete.

## Content strategy

*what content this site needs — page types, initial topics, format mix (long-form vs reference vs tool)*

Initially a single static landing page — hero, plain-language "how it works" in three steps, a before/after example transforming a cryptic error into a readable fix, and one email-capture field — no backend. Post-validation, the site grows into a programmatic SEO library off the core asset: one indexed page per resolved error signature ("Lindy webhook returns 401 — what it means and how to fix it," "n8n tool output not received — causes and fixes"), capturing the high-intent search a panicking operator makes at the moment of breakage. Format mix is one short conversion page now, scaling to reference-style error-fix pages (the pattern library as content) plus the eventual free YouTube/agent diagnostic tools that serve as the broader tool-first funnel.

### Post-deploy checklist (do these once after the first successful deploy)

- [ ] Verify in **Google Search Console** at https://search.google.com/search-console — add as `sc-domain:drdebug.dev` property; verify via DNS TXT record. Until this is done, no SEO traffic data is observable for this site (and the workspace-wide `30 commercial sites with traffic` goal can't credit it).
- [ ] Submit the sitemap (`https://drdebug.dev/sitemap.xml`) inside GSC.
- [ ] Update the **Live URL** above with the actual deploy URL.
- [ ] Run `make run ARGS="cleanup"` from `sites/portfolio/` so `data/portfolio.json` reflects the new project's state (and `project status drdebug.dev` resolves cleanly).

## How to run

```bash
# from this dir, after `make buildsh` from sites/:
make deps      # → pnpm install via the central builder
make run       # → dev server
make build     # → dist/
make test      # → pnpm install + build + test (must be inside container)
```

## How this project is checked

This project is enforced against shared sites/* conventions by
`portfolio project check drdebug.dev` (run from `sites/portfolio/`).
Conformance is driven by the universal check catalog (CHECK_*) —
e.g. CHECK_020 (own-git-repo), CHECK_002 (has-ai-agents-md),
CHECK_007 (has-docs-prompts), CHECK_008 (has-docs-growth — `docs/growth.md`
exists — the per-project growth-experiment log; see Growth log section
below), CHECK_001 (has-readme), CHECK_009 (has-gitignore), CHECK_035
(vite-version-ok), CHECK_003 / CHECK_004 (AI_AGENTS.md `## Building info` +
`## Deployment info` headings). See the full catalog with
`portfolio check catalog`. The bootstrap output satisfies all of these on
day zero — keep it that way.

If `project check` flags a regression, fix it. v6.C's `portfolio project fix`
will eventually auto-fix; until then, hand-edit.

## Growth log — per-project experiment tracker

`docs/growth.md` is this project's append-only log of growth experiments
(content, SEO, marketing, structural changes). Each entry is a dated H2
with a measurable hypothesis + KPI + observation window (default 28d).
Read **the full workflow inside `docs/growth.md`** — it's self-sustaining
so you don't have to remember the lifecycle from outside the file.

Update it whenever you do something growth-relevant on this site. The
data source is GSC (`portfolio gsc sync` from the portfolio dir); this
file narrates *why*.

## Strategy reminder — ship fast, let the market decide

This sites/* workspace is shipping commercial sites toward a
**30-site SEO-traffic goal**. The convention is **build & ship fast,
then let GSC data drive what to invest more in.** Don't over-polish
before launch. Get a minimum-viable version live, indexed, then
iterate on whichever sites actually attract traffic.

Translation for this project: prefer shipping over perfection. The
SEO baseline files (`public/robots.txt`, `public/sitemap.xml`),
deploy config, and dev tooling (`vitest`) are pre-scaffolded so you
can ship today.

## Versioning

This project follows the sites/* **canonical versioning convention** (defined
in `sites/portfolio/AI_AGENTS.md`):

- **`vN`** — major capability tier. Each is a coherent shipped capability and
  may break compat with the previous tier. SemVer-MAJOR semantics.
- **`vN.X`** — phase letter within a tier (A / B / C / …). Internal slicing of
  build work; signals "order/scope can shift." Each phase still ships
  independently.
- **`vN.X.Y`** — numeric sub-phase for follow-up work that lands AFTER `vN.X`
  shipped (e.g. polish, bug fixes, scope cuts).

Two-layer notation separates **external version** (what consumers see) from
**internal phasing** (how the team slices work). Letters signal *un-promised* —
nobody mistakes `v1.B` for a SemVer minor release.

**Always use this numbering when planning or shipping work on this project.**
Specifically:

- Every entry in `docs/prd.md`'s phases table uses `vN.X` (or `vN.X.Y`).
- Every commit message that ships a phase mentions its version (e.g.
  `v1.B — auth flow`).
- Every entry in `docs/Prompts.md` references the version of the work it
  describes when relevant.

Don't introduce a parallel scheme (no `0.1.0` / `Sprint 3` / etc.). When in
doubt, the canonical statement is `sites/portfolio/AI_AGENTS.md`.

Track this project's progress in `docs/prd.md` against this taxonomy. v0.A is
the bootstrap (this scaffold); v1.A is the first real shipped capability.

## Conventions

- Stack: astro
- **Package manager: pnpm only.** No `bun.lockb`, no `package-lock.json`, no `yarn.lock` — they cause CF Pages to pick the wrong manager and break the build. The `pnpm-lock.yaml` is the only lockfile that should ever be committed.
- Build path: this project's `Makefile` → `../Makefile` → `~/work/projects/builder/`
- Cloudflare deploy constraints: Vite ≥ 6, frozen-lockfile install, no `_redirects` SPA fallback (handled by `wrangler.jsonc`'s `not_found_handling` instead).
- **Versioning**: two-level `vN` / `vN.X` — see Versioning section above and `sites/portfolio/AI_AGENTS.md` for the canonical statement.
